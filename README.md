Final-RSS-News
==============
To run the RSS feed reader just run node app.js (key point make sure that the mongo database collection is empty and a mongo
instance is running)
The main code for the RSS feed reader is located in the index.js file

To run the twitter scrapper go to /test and run node twitterScraper.js and then either a possible hashtag (one word, no # sign
needed) or url of a website (note currently works with huffpo articles or youtube videos)
